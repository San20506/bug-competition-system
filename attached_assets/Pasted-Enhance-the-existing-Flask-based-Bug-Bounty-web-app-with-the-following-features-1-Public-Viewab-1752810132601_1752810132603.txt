Enhance the existing Flask-based Bug Bounty web app with the following features:

✅ 1. Public Viewable QR Code for Bugged Website (Teams Can View, Admin Can Modify)
Purpose: Teams should be able to view the bugged website’s QR code, but only the admin can modify the URL.

Behavior:
Create a new route /bug:

Shows a read-only page displaying:

QR code of the bugged website

Clickable URL to open it directly

Create or reuse a route /admin/bug_qr to:

Allow admin to upload or change the bugged site URL

Regenerate the QR code

QR code should be generated using the Python qrcode module and saved in static/bugsite_qr.png.

Store the bugged site URL in a persistent file like admin/bug_url.txt.

✅ 2. Timer: Countdown in mm:ss with Team-Side Live Update
Purpose: Improve the UX by showing a dynamic countdown in mm:ss format on the team submission page.

Behavior:
Backend sends remaining time in seconds.

Frontend uses JavaScript to:

Show a live-updating countdown.

Display "Time's up!" when countdown hits zero.

Timer logic remains in admin/status.json with:

start_time, status, duration in minutes

✅ 3. Leaderboard with Detailed Logging
Purpose: Clearly display which team submitted what, how much score they got, and the time taken.

Behavior:
Modify /leaderboard route:

Show the following fields:

Team Name

Score

Time Taken (in mm:ss format)

Sort leaderboard:

Score descending

Then time ascending

Pull values from SQLite scores table:

Fields: id, name, score, duration (in seconds)

✅ 4. Admin-Only Controls (Secure & Centralized)
Purpose: Ensure only admins can:

Modify the QR code/URL

Reset scores

Start or stop the timer

Update team passwords

Add/remove teams

Behavior:
Use session auth (already implemented) to:

Gate all admin features behind /admin/dashboard

Lock form submissions and buttons unless session['admin'] is True

✅ 5. Suggested Supporting Files
admin/status.json → for timer state

admin/bug_url.txt → stores bug site URL

static/bugsite_qr.png → QR image

database.db → SQLite DB storing teams and scores

✅ Example Team CSV for Testing
csv
Copy
Edit
name,password
TeamAlpha,alpha123
BugSquashers,squash404
ErrorHunters,error007
NullPointers,nullnull
Each team should:

Be able to log in using their name + password

Submit a zip only when the timer is active

See their result after submission
